# COVID-19-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
Detecting COVID-19 in dataset of 5000+ patients using eXtreme Gradient Boosting Algorithm (XGB) , the data was analyzed, cleaned and balanced 
and then provided to the XGB Model to make 0/1 predictions for COVID-19 Diagnosis in patients. The model's performance was compared to 
other cotemporary algorithms such as Random Forest , Decision Tree and Logistic Regression. The model achieved an Accuracy of 94.2% and
Recall of 93.7% , ROC AUC of 94.2% and Precision of 93.7%.
